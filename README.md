# pyChat
A P2P chat program in Python

TBD:

Well, implement the whole thing.

1. Figure out threading/queues/async to allow the user to send and recv at the same time

	a. User should launch program and decide if they are going to wait for a connection or "dial out"

	b. How to handle firewalls/antivirus/etc?

2. Eventually build into a GUI
3. Encryption?
4. FTP for transferring files?
